# Build and Running the program locally

On Mac or Linux, there should be a C Compiler built-in named "cc"... 

```
$cc -ohello hello.c
$ ./hello
```

**NOTES:**

* The first commannd compiles the file named `hello.c` and produces the executable program named **hello**
* The second commannd runs the **hello** program

Or, with gcc (GNU C Compiler)...

```
$gcc -ohello hello.c
$ ./hello
```
